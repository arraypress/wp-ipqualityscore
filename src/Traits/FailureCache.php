 *
 * Without this, an API that is down or out of quota is re-asked on every
 * single request, and each one waits out the full HTTP timeout before giving
 * up. On a checkout that is the difference between a slow page and an
 * abandoned basket. A quota error is worse still: retrying it per request
 * burns the next allowance as fast as it is granted.
